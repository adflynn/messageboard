A simple application built for raspberry pi

## Goal / Motivation
Create a digital white board application for my grandmother, to keep myself in touch with her throughout the day and keep her aware of the date/time and daily tasks.

The project is in French, but could easily be forked and updated with any language :)


## Key Features
* Uncrowded display to avoid confusion
* Update as new messages come in, but persist messages to give time for them to be seen (and reseen)
* Display current day and time
* Display upcoming events 

## Tech Used
Raspberry pi + speaker + monitor

Vanilla Javascript for front end.
Python for back end.

Integrations with Google Calendar & Gmail
